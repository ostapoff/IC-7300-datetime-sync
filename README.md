# IC-7300-datetime-sync
iCom 7300 date and time synchronization with the PC

Inspired by https://github.com/loughkb/IC-7300-time-sync 

Original script required the Python to be installed to run. Since the Windows10 comes with the PowerShell scripting system the script was rewritten from scratch, along with the time the date is synchronized.
